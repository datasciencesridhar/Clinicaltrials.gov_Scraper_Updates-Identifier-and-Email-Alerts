      "08 October 2018 In progress, Sanofi agrees to commence the appraisal for dupilumab (Dupixent) in patients with moderate to severe asthma from age 12 years upwards (subject to regulatory approval from June 2019 and in accordance with the new NICE process). Sanofi accepts that the revised timelines were agreed at the request of Sanofi (the Manufacturer), and any impact upon the timing of the NICE appraisal of this indication is the responsibility of Sanofi. Dupilumab in asthma is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as a licence extension for dupilumab (Dupixent). The NHS will only be able to commit to funding this medicine for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe asthma once NICE has conducted a Technology Appraisal on this topic.\n",
